# problem statement
# Nowdays China spends millions of dollars to create city itelleignece, which based on skynet project, the most created video secrity system in most cities. The goal is to build security and safety environments and prompt the stable development of Chinese economy. Person re-identification is not new to data scientist, software engineer, but to create high accuracy and reliable identification algorthims to predict the correct identities must be considered. 
We have cameras around cities, parks, shopping malls, airports and communities. Each person could be captured by several carmeras at the same time. However, there are always blank spots since it's impossible to set up cameras everywhere due to the costs. Also the camera angles for capturing images are not always ideal for every pedistrians. The images captured by cameras must be identified and analyzed to have business values. But we often captures no face, backs, lean down, and change fits persons. We can't garuannte to catch every single movement of a person without interruption. If a person walks from home to shopping mall, he would be captuerd by several cameras and tracking his routes. He could take off his yellow coat in shopping mall and carry new bought backpack and sit on bench to rest. So do the cameria recongaize the same person as two different ones? or same one. State-of-art methods are proposed based on deep nerual network. 
In this project, we are targeting a small network MobileNetV2 on small image datasets and trying to build an identification process on pedistricians and validating the models by learning rate decay, label smoothing, batch normalization, data generator, similarity analysis, etc.
